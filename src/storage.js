/**@
 * #.storage
 * @comp Storage
 * @sign .storage(String key)
 * @param key - a key you would like to get from the storage. It will return null if the key does not exists.
 * @sign .storage(String key, String value)
 * @param key - the key you would like to save the data under.
 * @param value - the value you would like to save.
 * @sign .storage(String key, [Object value, Array value, Boolean value])
 * @param key - the key you would like to save the data under.
 * @param value - the value you would like to save, can be an Object or an Array.
 *
 * Storage function is very simple and can be used to either get or set values. 
 * You can store both booleans, strings, objects and arrays.
 *
 * Please note: You should not store data, while the game is playing, as it can cause the game to slow down. You should load data when you start the game, or when the user for an example click a "Save gameprocess" button.
 *
 * @example
 * Get an already stored value
 * ~~~
 * var playername = Crafty.storage('playername');
 * ~~~
 *
 * @example
 * Save a value
 * ~~~
 * Crafty.storage('playername', 'Hero');
 * ~~~
 *
 * @example
 * Test to see if a value is already there.
 * ~~~
 * var heroname = Crafty.storage('name');
 * if(!heroname){
 *   // Maybe ask the player what their name is here
 *   heroname = 'Guest';
 * }
 * // Do something with heroname
 * ~~~
