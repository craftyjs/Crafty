     * Sets the image smoothing for drawing images (for all layer types).
     *
     * Setting this to true disables smoothing for images, which is the preferred
     * way for drawing pixel art. Defaults to false.
     *
     * This feature is experimental and you should be careful with cross-browser compatibility. 
     * The best way to disable image smoothing is to use the Canvas render method and the Sprite component for drawing your entities.
     *
     * If you want to switch modes in the middle of a scene, 
     * be aware that canvas entities won't be drawn in the new style until something else invalidates them. 
     * (You can manually invalidate all canvas entities with `Crafty("Canvas").trigger("Invalidate");`)
     *
     * @note Firefox_26 currently has a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=696630) 
     * which prevents disabling image smoothing for Canvas entities that use the Image component. Use the Sprite
     * component instead.
     *
     * @note Webkit (Chrome & Safari) currently has a bug [link1](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=134040) 
     * [link2](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=106662) that prevents disabling image smoothing
     * for DOM entities.

     * This is the preferred way to draw pixel art with the best cross-browser compatibility.
