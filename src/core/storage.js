/**@
 * #Storage
 * @category Utilities
 * @kind Component
 * 
 * Very simple way to get and set values, which will persist when the browser is closed also.
 * Storage wraps around HTML5 Web Storage, which is well-supported across browsers and platforms, but limited to 5MB total storage per domain.
 * Storage is also available for node, which is permanently persisted to the `./localStorage` folder - take care of removing entries. Note that multiple Crafty instances use the same storage, so care has to be taken not to overwrite existing entries.

/**@
 * #Crafty.storage
 * @comp Storage
 * @kind Method
 * 
 * @sign Crafty.storage(String key)
 * @param key - a key you would like to get from the storage. 
 * @returns The stored value, or `null` if none saved under that key exists
 *
 * @sign Crafty.storage(String key, String value)
 * @param key - the key you would like to save the data under.
 * @param value - the value you would like to save.
 *
 * @sign Crafty.storage(String key, [Object value, Array value, Boolean value])
 * @param key - the key you would like to save the data under.
 * @param value - the value you would like to save, can be an Object or an Array.
 *
 * `Crafty.storage` is used synchronously to either get or set values. 
 *
 * You can store booleans, strings, objects and arrays.
 *
 * @note Because the underlying method is synchronous, it can cause slowdowns if used frequently during gameplay.
 * You should aim to load or save data at reasonable times such as on level load,
 * or in response to specific user actions.
 *
 * @note If used in a cross-domain context, the localStorage might not be accessible.
 *
 * @example
 * Get an already stored value
 * ~~~
 * var playername = Crafty.storage('playername');
 * ~~~
 *
 * @example
 * Save a value
 * ~~~
 * Crafty.storage('playername', 'Hero');
 * ~~~
 *
 * @example
 * Test to see if a value is already there.
 * ~~~
 * var heroname = Crafty.storage('name');
 * if(!heroname){
 *   // Maybe ask the player what their name is here
 *   heroname = 'Guest';
 * }
 * // Do something with heroname
 * ~~~
